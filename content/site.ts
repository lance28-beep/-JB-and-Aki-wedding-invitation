  narrative: `Our story began the moment we met, unplanned, unexpected, yet perfectly timed.

That day, I already had plans with a friend, but at the last minute, those plans changed. My friend decided to join another group instead, the same group he was with. Since I also knew some of the people there, I was invited to come along. Had I not agreed, I would have missed the moment our story quietly began.

We are very different in many ways. He is loud, outgoing, and full of energy, while I am calm, quiet, and more reserved. Yet those differences became our strength. Where he brings excitement, I bring balance, and together, we complement each other perfectly.

One thing we immediately shared was our love for food. It became our way of connecting, sharing meals, exploring new places, and creating memories through the simplest moments.

And before we knew it, life no longer felt complete without each other. What began as a coincidence slowly turned into something constant and meaningful.

And from there, the rest became history.`,
